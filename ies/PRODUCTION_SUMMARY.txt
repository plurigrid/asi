Total Execution Time: ~48 seconds
Peak Memory: ~600MB
Total Output Size: ~4.5MB

DATA PROCESSING
================

Input: 26 worlds, 407 projects
Output: 166 skills, 291 objects, 830 morphisms

Embedding Space:
  - Dimension: 384
  - Method: Deterministic semantic encoding
  - Properties: Unit-normalized, reproducible

Skill Graph:
  - Vertices: 166 skills
  - Edges: 830 GOKO k-NN morphisms
  - Metric: Wasserstein distance
  - Network Density: 6.06%

Topological Projection:
  - Method: IsUMAP (geodesic-preserving)
  - Clusters: 6 (silhouette=0.6153)
  - Dimensions: 2D and 3D outputs

QUALITY METRICS
================

Cluster Quality:
  ✓ Silhouette Score: 0.6153 (Strong)
  ✓ Separation Ratio: 2.60×
  ✓ Cluster Count: 6

Geodesic Preservation:
  ~ Spearman Correlation: -0.2858 (Fair)
  ~ k-NN Preservation (k=10): 3.7%
  Note: Expected loss due to heavy dimensionality reduction

GF(3) Conservation:
  ~ Conservation Rate: 16.7% (1/6 clusters)
  Note: Projection inherently breaks category-theoretic structure

RECOMMENDATIONS
================

For Visualization:
  → Use isumap_visualization.html for interactive exploration
  → Use 3D projection for better geodesic preservation

For Curriculum Design:
  → Use cluster assignments for skill grouping
  → Use GOKO morphisms for progression paths
  → Use semantic closures to identify bridge concepts

For Scaling:
  → Current: 166 skills in 48 seconds
  → Target 1000 skills: Implement LSH/HNSW approximation
  → Target 10000 skills: Use hierarchical clustering

For Improvement:
  → Increase IsUMAP n_neighbors for better geodesic preservation
  → Apply GF(3)-constrained post-processing if needed
  → Consider continuous manifold learning for category preservation

NEXT STEPS
===========

1. Integrate embeddings into your ASI skill system
2. Use projections for visualizations
3. Use GOKO distances for curriculum pacing
4. Monitor quality metrics as data grows
5. Plan scaling strategy for >1000 skills
