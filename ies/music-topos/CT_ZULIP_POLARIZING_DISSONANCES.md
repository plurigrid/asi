## 🔥 MAJOR DISSONANCE 1: Elementary vs Grothendieck Topos Terminology

**Key Players**: Kevin Carlson, Alex Kreitzberg, John Baez

**The Tension**: What does "topos" even mean?

> **Kevin Carlson** (2025-11-19): "A category of presheaves *is* a category of sheaves (ie Grothendieck topos), which *is* an elementary topos, which *is* category with a subobject classifier. But all these implications are irreversible. Most category theorists saying 'topos' mean 'elementary topos', but for historical reasons and the fact that Grothendieck toposes are pretty great, it's far from unheard of to use 'topos' to mean 'Grothendieck topos.'"

> **Alex Kreitzberg** (2025-11-19): "I tried to reverse engineer how the terminology is used on the nlab, but I wouldn't be surprised if my usage, or understanding, are confused... I found this odd, because i[t was] up to the reader to establish from context whether it was a grothendieck topos or an elementary topos."

> **Fernando Yamauti** (2025-11-04): "'Topos' for me means always 'Grothendieck topos'"

## 🔥 MAJOR DISSONANCE 2: ZFC vs ETCS Foundations

**Key Players**: David Michael Roberts, Mike Shulman, Kevin Carlson, John Baez

**The Tension**: Do you need sets to define categories?

> **David Michael Roberts** (2025-09-17): "Thinking that one needs sets to define categories is a fallacy that people entrenched in set theory bring up when trying to belittle using eg ETCS as a foundation."

> **Mike Shulman** (2025-09-17): "You can't define first-order syntax formally without some kind of sets. But they don't have to be ZFC-sets, they could equally well be ETCS-sets."

> **David Michael Roberts** (2025-10-22): "In the 1960s you had two things happen: Lawvere invented ETCS, a set theory that suffices for 99.99% of non-set-theory mathematics... and the invention of forcing by Cohen, which showed set theorists that essentially the ZFC axioms of set theory severely underdetermine how sets behave."

> **John Baez** (2025-10-16): "You are blending category theory and traditional logic (untyped first-order logic and material set theory like ZFC) in a way that seems not to have been studied as much as it should be... Why is this? I think it's because people who care about 'syntactic categories' tend to shun untyped first-order logic and material set theory."

## 🔥 MAJOR DISSONANCE 3: Structural vs Material Set Theory

**Key Players**: Amar Hadzihasanovic, John Baez

**The Tension**: The nature of mathematical "matter"

> **Amar Hadzihasanovic** (2025-12-09): "While category theory is often associated with mathematical structuralism, I would say that the particular flavour of CT is less of a choice of structuralism over materialism, and more of a 'blurring of boundaries' between the two, a 'monistic' approach... Set-theoretic mathematics have a kind of built-in dualism where 'structure' is at the logical level, 'matter' is sets, and 'implementation' or 'interpretation' is a one-way channel from logic to sets; in CT, typically, 'structure' and 'matter' are really just the domain and codomain of a functor."

---

## 🔥 MAJOR DISSONANCE 4: Constructive vs Classical Logic

**Key Players**: James Deikun, John Baez, Madeleine Birchfield, Alex Kreitzberg

**The Tension**: Excluded middle, finiteness, and what counts as proof

> **James Deikun** (2025-09-18): "This definition (Dedekind finiteness) only leads to a satisfactory definition of string classically, and MLTT is often used for constructive or intuitionistic reasoning."

> **John Baez** (2025-07-27): "Constructive logic, the logic of verification, codifies some of the blue team principles you enunciate. But co-constructive logic, which seems to be a more recent topic of interest, is the logic of refutation."

> **Madeleine Birchfield** (2025-08-02): "What exactly are the real numbers? There are so many different models of real numbers, such as Cauchy real numbers, Escardo-Simpson real numbers, Dedekind real numbers, MacNeille real numbers... most of which are provably not equivalent to each other [constructively]."

> **Alex Kreitzberg** (2025-09-20): "I'm understanding Bishop's constructive mathematics, for example, to be a result of carefully thinking about foundational issues with the continuum. And it has practical consequences on how people do math."

## 🔥 MAJOR DISSONANCE 5: Synthetic Differential Geometry - Overkill?

**Key Players**: John Baez, Alex Kreitzberg, Chris Grossack

**The Tension**: Is SDG worth the learning curve?

> **John Baez** (2024-10-15): "Personally I find synthetic geometry to be overkill for doing ordinary differential geometry - perhaps because I already know ordinary differential geometry... Synthetic differential geometry seems more profitable if you want to 'seamlessly generalize the traditional theory to a range of enhanced contexts, such as super-geometry, higher (stacky) differential geometry, or even a combination of both'."

> **John Baez** (2024-09-26): "If we were doing synthetic differential geometry this would be a snap - after you've spent ten years learning synthetic differential geometry. 🙃"

> **Alex Kreitzberg** (2024-12-14): "I'm positive they didn't have synthetic differential geometry in mind... they were quick to point out 'geometry' in as large as a sense I meant, wasn't a real field of study."

---

## 🔥 MAJOR DISSONANCE 6: Lawvere's "Radical" Foundational Stance

**Key Players**: Gabriel Goren Roig, Matt Earnshaw, David Michael Roberts

**The Tension**: Lawvere's dismissal of inconsistency concerns

> **Gabriel Goren Roig** (2025-10-18): "There are many statements here that seem very strong to me: 'The past 100 years' tradition of foundations as justification has not helped mathematics very much.' The usage of the word 'foundation' in the sense of justification is *reactionary*. The attention given to the possibility that mathematics is consistent has been 'excessive' for the past century."

> **Matt Earnshaw** (2025-10-23): "I don't think that by 'alleged', Lawvere meant to call the study of inconsistency as such into question. Rather, it is important that he says 'alleged inconsistency *of mathematics*'. I do think it consistent to cast doubt on such a thing, because inconsistency is a property of formal systems, and it does not appear that the *global* practice of mathematics is taking [on that property]."

## 🔥 DISSONANCE 7: 2-Topos & Higher Categorical Logic

**Key Players**: Ivan Di Liberti, Mike Shulman, Matteo Capucci

**The Tension**: Credit and progress in 2-dimensional topos theory

> **Ivan Di Liberti** (2025-11-06): "A good starting point to enter the modern development of the topic is the PhD thesis of Luca Mesiti 'Aspects of 2-dimensional Elementary Topos Theory'... Quite correctly, the thesis makes no reference to anything by Shulman, as no contribution was ever provided [by him to this topic]."

---

## 🔥 DISSONANCE 8: Category Theory Being "Co-Opted"

**Key Players**: John Baez, Joe Moeller

**The Tension**: Applied CT diluting pure mathematics

> **John Baez** (2025-09-08): "**Selective Adoption**: The applied world eagerly adopts the parts of category theory that are immediately useful. Computer scientists, for instance, use categorical concepts to bring order to programming languages..."

---

## 🔥 DISSONANCE 9: Well-Pointed Toposes & Finiteness

**Key Players**: David Michael Roberts, Haruki Toyota

**The Tension**: Giraud's theorem generalization

> **David Michael Roberts** (2025-12-04): "I find the fact Dedekind's second definition doesn't require using a set of subsets appealing... So it seems to me that the definition makes sense in say any Boolean pretopos. I'd not be surprised if a lot of Dedekind's note works in a general well-pointed Boolean category."

> **Haruki Toyota** (2025-11-27): "I think one of the beauties of Giraud's theorem described in the Elephant is that it holds relative to any elementary topos. Is there a generalization from Set to elementary topoi or weaker categories?"

---

## 🔥 DISSONANCE 10: Physics & Category Theory Stagnation

**Key Players**: Paolo Perrone

**The Tension**: Is fancy math helping physics?

> **Paolo Perrone** (2025-10-23): "Personally I think that the main reason why high-energy physics is so stagnant is because the majority of the community, a long time ago, stopped being interested in figuring out *what is really going on*, and started just 'calculating things'. (Not everyone is like that, thankfully, for example Urs Schreiber is not.) With this attitude, no amount of fancy math is going to help, not category theory, not positive geometry, not non-commutative geometry."
