A graph looks this:\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.svg)\\n\\nFormally, a **simple graph** G=(V,E)G = (V,E)G=(V,E) is a set of vertices VVV equipped with an edge relation EEE: a binary relation EEE on VVV that is symmetric (E(v,u)E(v,u)E(v,u) whenever E(u,v)E(u,v)E(u,v), for all vertices u,v∈Vu,v \\\\\\\\in Vu,v∈V) and irreflexive (E(v,v)E(v,v)E(v,v) for _no_ vertex v∈Vv \\\\\\\\in Vv∈V). In a **simple digraph** the symmetry axiom is dropped, so that the edges are directed. Graphs and digraphs are basic objects in discrete mathematics, are the source of fundamental data structures in computer science, and are ubiquitous throughout the scientific and engineering fields.\\n\\nDespite this, the concept of a simple graph is often unsatisfactory for both theoretical and practical reasons. From an algebraic viewpoint, the category of simple graphs is surprisingly badly behaved. [1](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/#fn1) Moreover, experience shows that there is not a single concept of graph suitable for all applications, but rather that graphs belong to a rich family of related concepts. Graphs in scientific and engineering applications tend to have additional structure that is either ignored or shoehorned into the graph model through ad hoc encodings. The AlgebraicJulia ecosystem, and the field of applied category theory generally, aim to define a flexible, unified framework for scientific modeling using algebraic structures, subsuming and vastly extending the graph data model.\\n\\nThrough the course of this blog we will encounter a diverse cast of algebraic structures generalizing the concept of a graph. In this post we start at the very beginning, with how category theorists understand graphs, how graphs are an example of a general class of structures called “C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets,” and how C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets can be used as data structures in Julia through [Catlab.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl).\\n\\n## Graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/\\\\#graphs)\\n\\nFor a category theorist, a **graph** GGG consists of two sets, a vertex set G(V)G(V)G(V) and an edge set G(E)G(E)G(E), together with two functions G(src⁡),G(tgt⁡):G(E)→G(V)G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}), G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}):\\nG(E) \\\\\\\\to G(V)G(src),G(tgt):G(E)→G(V). Every edge e∈G(E)e \\\\\\\\in G(E)e∈G(E) in the graph has a **source** vertex e⋅src⁡:=G(src⁡)(e)e\\n\\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{src}:= G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{src})(e)e⋅src:=G(src)(e) and a **target** vertex e⋅tgt⁡:=G(tgt⁡)(e)e \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}:= G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt})(e)e⋅tgt:=G(tgt)(e). Thus, a graph is directed, may have multiple edges between two vertices, and may have loops, making it what a graph theorist would call a “multidigraph.” Moreover, the edges are explicitly identified as the elements of an edge set, rather than being pairs of vertices. While this may seem strange, we will gradually see that it has many advantages.\\n\\nIn Catlab, the definition of a graph is captured by the schema:\\n\\n```\\nusing Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra\\n\\n@present SchGraph(FreeSchema) begin\\n  V::Ob\\n  E::Ob\\n  src::Hom(E,V)\\n  tgt::Hom(E,V)\\nend\\n```\\n\\nThe names `Ob` and `Hom` are short for “object” and “morphism,” interpreted as sets and functions in this context. Having defined the schema for graphs, the module `Graphs` in Catlab creates a Julia data type for graphs like this: [2](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/#fn2)\\n\\n```\\n@acset_type Graph(SchGraph, index=[:src,:tgt])\\n```\\n\\nLet’s create a graph using the generated interface.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nusing Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra\\nusing Catlab.Graphs, Catlab.Graphics\\n\\ng = Graph()\\nadd_parts!(g, :V, 3)\\nadd_parts!(g, :E, 4, src=[1,2,2,3], tgt=[2,3,3,3])\\ng\\n```\\n\\nCatlab.Graphs.BasicGraphs.Graph with elements V = 1:3, E = 1:4\\n\\n| 1 | 1 | 2 |\\n| 2 | 2 | 3 |\\n| 3 | 2 | 3 |\\n| 4 | 3 | 3 |\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nto_graphviz(g)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.svg)\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nto_graphviz(g, node_labels=true, edge_labels=true)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.svg)\\n\\nAs the visualization shows, edges 2, 3, and 4 are all incident to vertex 3 via the target map:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nincident(g, 3, :tgt)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\\n 2\\n 3\\n 4\\n```\\n\\nAs a convenience, the `Graphs` module wraps the generated methods with an interface inspired by [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl), defining methods such as `nv`, `ne`, `add_vertex!`, `add_edge!`, `inneighbors`, and `outneighbors`. For example, the following code reduces to the code constructing the graph `g` above:\\n\\n```\\ng = Graph()\\nadd_vertices!(g, 3)\\nadd_edges!(g, [1,2,2,3], [2,3,3,3])\\n```\\n\\n## Graphs as C-sets [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/\\\\#graphs-as-c-sets)\\n\\nGraphs are an example of a class of structures called C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets. This was just illustrated by code and will now be explained mathematically.\\n\\nC\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets are defined relative to a small category C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C. In this context, the category C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C is interpreted as a schema, describing the kinds of parts in the structure and the subpart relations between them. For example, the **schema for graphs** is the category Sch(Graph)\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{Graph})Sch(Graph) presented by:\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/_svgs/d4281f1cd8d28667e0a8e0b2fed680c670b46d4c.svg)\\n\\nYou may be used to thinking about large categories, such as the category Set\\\\\\\\mathsf{Set}Set of all sets and functions, but the category Sch(Graph)\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{Graph})Sch(Graph) is very small! It has exactly two objects, EEE and VVV, and two non-identity morphisms, src⁡:E→V\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}: E \\\\\\\\to\\nVsrc:E→V and tgt⁡:E→V\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}: E \\\\\\\\to Vtgt:E→V. The interpretation is that there are two kinds of parts, of type VVV and EEE. Parts of type VVV have no subparts, while parts of type EEE have two subparts of type VVV, called src⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}src and tgt⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}tgt.\\n\\nGiven a small category C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C, a **C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set** is a functor X:C→SetX: \\\\\\\\mathsf{C}\\n\\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\mathsf{Set}X:C→Set. [3](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/#fn3) A C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set XXX therefore consists of, for every object c∈Cc\\n\\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathsf{C}c∈C, a set X(c)X(c)X(c), and for every morphism f:c→df: c \\\\\\\\to df:c→d in C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C, a function X(f):X(c)→X(d)X(f): X(c) \\\\\\\\to X(d)X(f):X(c)→X(d), subject to the functoriality axioms.

The interface takes care of adding edges in pairs related by the involution, allowing the symmetric graphs to be treated as undirected graphs. For example, the symmetric 4-cycle is constructed like this:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\ng = SymmetricGraph()\\nadd_vertices!(g, 4)\\nadd_edges!(g, [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,1])\\ng\\n```\\n\\nCatlab.Graphs.BasicGraphs.SymmetricGraph with elements V = 1:4, E = 1:8\\n\\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 5 |\\n| 2 | 2 | 3 | 6 |\\n| 3 | 3 | 4 | 7 |\\n| 4 | 4 | 1 | 8 |\\n| 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 |\\n| 6 | 3 | 2 | 2 |\\n| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 |\\n| 8 | 1 | 4 | 4 |\\n\\nSymmetric graphs are visualized as undirected graphs, where the drawn edges are labeled by directed edge pairs.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\n to_graphviz(g, prog=\\\"circo\\\")\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/index_files/figure-html/cell-8-output-1.svg)\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nto_graphviz(g, prog=\\\"circo\\\", node_labels=true, edge_labels=true)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/index_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.svg)\\n\\nIn the next installment we’ll see how more exotic notions of graph are realized as C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets and data structures in Catlab.\\n\\n## References [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/\\\\#references)\\n\\nReyes, Marie La Palme, Gonzalo E.

Such graphs mildly generalize the concept of graph familiar from combinatorics and computer science. They are preferred by category theorists because every small category has an underlying graph in this sense, [1](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#fn1) and so categories can be seen as graphs with composable edges. There is, however, another notion of graph, based on “half-edges” or “darts,” that is popular in parts of physics ( [Marcolli and Port 2015](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#ref-marcolli2015); [Markl, Merkulov, and Shadrin 2009](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#ref-markl2009)), topological graph theory ( [Lando and Zvonkin 2004](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#ref-lando2004)), and computational geometry.\\n\\nIn this post we introduce half-edge graphs and explain their close relation with symmetric graphs. We also show how half-edge graphs lead to “rotation systems,” an important concept of topological graph theory. Rotation systems perfectly capture the combinatorial information associated with a graph embedded in an oriented surface, up to continuous deformation.\\n\\n## Half-edge graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/\\\\#half-edge-graphs)\\n\\nA half-edge graph, instead of having edges, has _half-edges_ paired together by an involution.

A **half-edge graph**, or Sch(HGraph)\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{HGraph})Sch(HGraph)-set, GGG thus consists of a set of vertices G(V)G(V)G(V) and a set of half-edges G(H)G(H)G(H), where each half-edge h∈G(H)h \\\\\\\\in G(H)h∈G(H) is incident to a vertex h⋅vert⁡∈G(V)h \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}\\\\\\\\in G(V)h⋅vert∈G(V) and is paired with another half-edge h⋅inv⁡∈G(H)h \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}\\\\\\\\in\\nG(H)h⋅inv∈G(H) so that h⋅inv⁡⋅inv⁡=hh \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}\\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}= hh⋅inv⋅inv=h.\\n\\nIn Catlab, the schema and data type for half-edge graphs are defined as:\\n\\n```\\n@present SchHalfEdgeGraph(FreeSchema) begin\\n  V::Ob\\n  H::Ob\\n  vertex::Hom(H,V)\\n  inv::Hom(H,H)\\n\\n  compose(inv, inv) == id(H)\\nend\\n\\n@acset_type HalfEdgeGraph(SchHalfEdgeGraph, index=[:vertex])\\n```\\n\\nMany authors call half-edge graphs simply “graphs.” More importantly, some authors insist that the involution on half-edges be fixed-point free: h⋅inv⁡≠hh \\\\\\\\cdot\\n\\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}\\\\\\\\neq hh⋅inv=h for all h∈G(H)h \\\\\\\\in G(H)h∈G(H). There are two good reasons to drop this restriction. At a technical level, the property of having no fixed points is not algebraic and in particular cannot be expressed in the logic of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets. Also, the half-edges hhh fixed under the involution, h⋅inv⁡=hh \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}= hh⋅inv=h, have a natural interpretation as **dangling edges**. These half-edges are not paired with any others and so are left “dangling” at the boundary of the graph. By contrast, distinct half-edges h≠h′h \\\\\\\\neq h'h=h′ paired under the involution and incident to the same vertex, h⋅vert⁡=h′⋅vert⁡h \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}= h' \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}h⋅vert=h′⋅vert, are ordinary self-loops.\\n\\nAs with graphs and symmetric graphs, Catlab wraps that the generic C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets interface with a simple interface inspired by [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl). The functions `add_edge(s)!` add pairs of distinct half-edges, while the functions `add_dangling_edge(s)!` add half-edges fixed by the involution.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nusing Catlab.Graphs, Catlab.Graphics\\n\\ng = HalfEdgeGraph(3)\\nadd_edges!(g, [1,2,3], [2,3,1])\\nadd_dangling_edges!(g, [1,1,3])\\ng\\n```\\n\\nCatlab.Graphs.BasicGraphs.HalfEdgeGraph with elements V = 1:3, H = 1:9\\n\\n| 1 | 1 | 4 |\\n| 2 | 2 | 5 |\\n| 3 | 3 | 6 |\\n| 4 | 2 | 1 |\\n| 5 | 3 | 2 |\\n| 6 | 1 | 3 |\\n| 7 | 1 | 7 |\\n| 8 | 1 | 8 |\\n| 9 | 3 | 9 |\\n\\nWhen visualized, the dangling edges are distinguished from the full edges by being incident to a vertex on one side only.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nto_graphviz(g)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.svg)\\n\\n## Relation with symmetric graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/\\\\#relation-with-symmetric-graphs)\\n\\nJudging by the definitions, half-edge graphs look quite similar to [symmetric graphs](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1#symmetric_graphs). We can state the relationship between them very precisely using categorical language. First, some generalities about schema mappings.\\n\\nIf small categories are schemas, then functors between them must be schema mappings; from a slightly different point of view, if categories are theories, then functors are interpretations of one theory in another. Given a small category C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C, denote the category of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets as \\\\[C,Set\\\\]\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathsf{C},\\\\\\\\mathsf{Set}\\\\]\\\\[C,Set\\\\], using a standard notation for [functor categories](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/functor+category).

For example:\\n\\nF(inv⁡⨟⁡tgt⁡)=F(inv⁡)⨟⁡F(tgt⁡)=inv⁡2⨟⁡vert⁡=vert⁡=F(src⁡).\\nF(\\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}\\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}) = F(\\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}) \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}F(\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}) =\\n\\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}^2 \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}= \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}= F(\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}).\\nF(inv⨟tgt)=F(inv)⨟F(tgt)=inv2⨟vert=vert=F(src).\\n\\nThe functor is even invertible, with inverse F−1:Sch(HGraph)→Sch(SGraph)F^{-1}: \\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{HGraph}) \\\\\\\\to\\n\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{SGraph})F−1:Sch(HGraph)→Sch(SGraph) sending vert⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}vert to src⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}src.

The schema for symmetric graphs has an automorphism S:Sch(SGraph)→Sch(SGraph)S: \\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{SGraph}) \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{SGraph})S:Sch(SGraph)→Sch(SGraph) that exchanges src⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}src and tgt⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}tgt and preserves the other objects and morphisms. Composing this symmetry with FFF yields another isomorphism S⨟⁡F:Sch(SGraph)≅Sch(HGraph)S \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}F: \\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{SGraph}) \\\\\\\\cong\\n\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{HGraph})S⨟F:Sch(SGraph)≅Sch(HGraph), now sending src⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}src to inv⁡⨟⁡vert⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}\\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}inv⨟vert and tgt⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}tgt to vert⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}vert. Thus, if you want to interchange symmetric graphs with half-edge graphs, you must say _how_ you’re going to do it.\\n\\nEven with this caveat, if half-edge graphs are essentially the same as symmetric graphs, why introduce this extra concept? One reason is that that the two concepts have different interpretations. A loop in a symmetric graph can be fixed or not by the edge involution, [3](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#fn3) but both cases have the same interpretation, making no reference to dangling edges. Moreover, half-edge graphs are the starting point for a whole line of important structures in topological graph theory and computational geometry.\\n\\n## Rotation systems [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/\\\\#rotation-systems)\\n\\nConsider a half-edge graph embedded in an oriented surface such as the plane or the sphere. Is there any combinatorial information, besides the graph structure, that is invariant under continuous deformation (orientation-preserving homeomorphism)? Importantly, there is: the cyclic ordering of half-edges incident to each vertex, given by tracing a circle around the vertex according to the local orientation.\\n\\nThis extra information is captured by a [rotation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_system), an important concept of topological graph theory. A **graph with a rotation system** is a half-edge graph GGG equipped with a permutation σ:G(H)→G(H)\\\\\\\\sigma: G(H) \\\\\\\\to G(H)σ:G(H)→G(H) of half-edges, where each cycle of σ\\\\\\\\sigmaσ consists of the half-edges G(vert⁡)−1(v)G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{vert})^{-1}(v)G(vert)−1(v) incident to some vertex vvv of GGG. [4](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#fn4) Graphs with rotation systems are not quite C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets, since the constraint on the permutation cycles cannot be expressed, but a slightly more general structure is.\\n\\nThe **schema for rotation graphs** is the category generated by\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/_svgs/f6ae2236f9cfdc91f09a15b661e302c97fe1ced2.svg)\\n\\nsubject to the equations inv⁡2=1H\\\\\\\\operatorname{inv}^2 = 1\\\\_Hinv2=1H​ and σ⨟⁡vert⁡=vert⁡\\\\\\\\sigma \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}= \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}σ⨟vert=vert. The notation σ:H→≅H\\\\\\\\sigma: H \\\\\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\\\\\cong} Hσ:H≅​H means that σ\\\\\\\\sigmaσ is an isomorphism, shorthand for introducing another generating morphism σ−1:H→H\\\\\\\\sigma^{-1}:\\nH \\\\\\\\to Hσ−1:H→H that obeys the equations σ⨟⁡σ−1=1H=σ−1⨟⁡σ\\\\\\\\sigma \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\sigma^{-1} = 1\\\\_H =\\\\\\\\sigma^{-1}\\n\\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\sigmaσ⨟σ−1=1H​=σ−1⨟σ. A **rotation graph** is then a half-edge graph GGG with a permutation G(σ):G(H)→G(H)G(\\\\\\\\sigma): G(H) \\\\\\\\to G(H)G(σ):G(H)→G(H) such that half-edges belonging to the same cycle are incident to the same vertex: h⋅σ⋅vert⁡=vh \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\sigma \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}= vh⋅σ⋅vert=v whenever h⋅vert⁡=vh \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\operatorname{vert}= vh⋅vert=v. Unlike in a graph with a rotation system, multiple cycles may be incident to the same vertex.\\n\\nThe package [CombinatorialSpaces.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/CombinatorialSpaces.jl) provides combinatorial data structures for geometric objects. It defines the schema for rotation graphs as:\\n\\n```\\n@present SchRotationGraph <: SchHalfEdgeGraph begin\\n  σ::Hom(H,H)\\n\\n  compose(σ, vertex) == vertex\\nend\\n```\\n\\nThe choice of whether to include the inverse σ−1\\\\\\\\sigma^{-1}σ−1 in the schema depends on whether one wants to store and maintain the inverse or compute it on the fly, when needed. Future versions of Catlab may include better builtin support for constraints such as injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity.\\n\\nWhat if we insist that the schema enforce a one-to-one correspondence between vertices and cycles of the permutation σ\\\\\\\\sigmaσ? We can apply a little trick: if vertices should be identified with cycles of σ\\\\\\\\sigmaσ, then we need not explicitly represent vertices at all. This may seem strange but it is commonplace in data structures for computational geometry. [5](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#fn5) Specifically, the **schema for rotation systems** is the category Sch(RotSys)\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{RotSys})Sch(RotSys) generated by\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/_svgs/ebd93a2dd342b09698fdb25817c3671dad16e736.svg)\\n\\nsubject to the equation α2=1H\\\\\\\\alpha^2 = 1\\\\_Hα2=1H​. We follow tradition in writing α\\\\\\\\alphaα for the half-edge involution of a rotation system. [6](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#fn6) The category Sch(RotSys)\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{RotSys})Sch(RotSys) has only one object, making it a monoid, and every morphism is invertible, so it is even a group. Thus, a **rotation system**, or Sch(RotSys)\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{RotSys})Sch(RotSys)-set, is not just a category action but a [group action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action). In a rotation system, the orbits under σ\\\\\\\\sigmaσ are identified with vertices and the orbits under α\\\\\\\\alphaα with edges. Usually α\\\\\\\\alphaα is required to [act freely](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+action), thus barring dangling edges. Some authors also insist that the whole group ⟨σ,α⟩=Sch(RotSys)\\\\\\\\langle \\\\\\\\sigma, \\\\\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\rangle =\\n\\\\\\\\mathsf{Sch}(\\\\\\\\mathsf{RotSys})⟨σ,α⟩=Sch(RotSys) [act transitively](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transitive+action), which corresponds to the graph being connected.\\n\\nRotation systems are fundamental in topological graph theory because they correspond one-to-one with embeddings of graphs in oriented surfaces, up to equivalence under orientation-preserving homeomorphism ( [Gross and Tucker 1987](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#ref-tucker1987), Theorem 3.2.3). This statement has some fine print. First, it refers to **cellular embeddings**: embeddings of a graph GGG in a surface SSS such that every **region**, or connected component of the complement S∖GS \\\\\\\\setminus GS∖G, is homeomorphic to an open disk. In particular, no nonempty graph can be cellularly embedded in the plane, because the outer region will have a hole. However, cellular embeddings are commonly taken in the sphere, and any spherical embedding can be converted to a planar (noncellular) embedding by [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection). Related to this point, while every rotation system is embeddable in _some_ surface ( [Mohar and Thomassen 2001, sec. 3.2](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/#ref-mohar2001)), not every rotation system defines a planar graph; those that do are **planar rotation systems**.\\n\\nIn a future post, we will see how rotation systems can be extended to describe surface decompositions and faces of polyhedra.\\n\\n## References [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/\\\\#references)\\n\\nEllis-Monaghan, Joanna A., and Iain Moffatt. 2013. _Graphs on Surfaces_.

A [reflexive graph](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflexive+graph) is a graph where every vertex has a distinguished self-loop, like this:\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.svg)\\n\\nAt first glance, the self-loops may seem an inconsequential addition. It is even customary to omit them from drawings, making reflexive graphs more or less interchangeable with graphs as _objects_. However, the _morphisms_ of reflexive graphs differ significantly from those of graphs and as a result the category of reflexive graphs behaves differently than the category of graphs. We will see that reflexive graphs are more “geometric” than graphs in various ways. For example, if graphs GGG and HHH discretize continuous spaces XXX and YYY, then product G×HG \\\\\\\\times HG×H will discretize the product space X×YX \\\\\\\\times YX×Y only if the graphs are reflexive.\\n\\nThe story of reflexive graphs will give us opportunity to discuss morphisms of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets generally, which we have not yet done in this series. To understand this post, it will be helpful to have read [Part I](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/). It is not necessary to read [Part II](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-2/), which goes in a different direction.\\n\\n## Reflexive graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/\\\\#reflexive-graphs)\\n\\nA **reflexive graph** is a graph GGG together with a function G(refl⁡):G(V)→G(E)G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{refl}): G(V)\\n\\\\\\\\to G(E)G(refl):G(V)→G(E) that assigns to each vertex vvv a self-loop at vvv.

The functions (αc)c∈C(\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_c)\\\\_{c \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathsf{C}}(αc​)c∈C​ are called the **components** of the transformation.\\n\\nThe C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets and C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set homomorphisms then form a category, suggestively denoted C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-Set\\\\\\\\mathsf{Set}Set, where homomorphisms are composed componentwise and the identity homomorphism has each component the identity function. A homomorphism α\\\\\\\\alphaα of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets is an **isomorphism** if it has an inverse in C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-Set\\\\\\\\mathsf{Set}Set, which turns out to be equivalent to each component αc\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_cαc​ being an invertible function ( [Awodey 2010](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#ref-awodey2010), Lemma 7.11).\\n\\n## Morphisms of graphs and reflexive graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/\\\\#morphisms-of-graphs-and-reflexive-graphs)\\n\\nThe schema for graphs has only two objects, VVV and EEE, and two morphisms, src⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}src and tgt⁡\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}tgt, so a graph homomorphism α:G→H\\\\\\\\alpha: G \\\\\\\\to Hα:G→H consists of a vertex map αV:G(V)→H(V)\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_V: G(V) \\\\\\\\to H(V)αV​:G(V)→H(V) and an edge map αE:G(E)→H(E)\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_E: G(E) \\\\\\\\to H(E)αE​:G(E)→H(E) that preserves the source and target vertices:\\n\\nαE⨟⁡H(src⁡)=G(src⁡)⨟⁡αVandαE⨟⁡H(tgt⁡)=G(tgt⁡)⨟⁡αV.\\n\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_E \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}H(\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}) = G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{src}) \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_V\\n\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{and}\\\\\\\\qquad\\n\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_E \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}H(\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}) = G(\\\\\\\\operatorname{tgt}) \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\_V.\\nαE​⨟H(src)=G(src)⨟αV​andαE​⨟H(tgt)=G(tgt)⨟αV​.\\n\\nWhen HHH is a simple directed graph (has at most one directed edge between any two vertices), the edge map is completely determined by the vertex map and we recover the usual notion of [simple graph homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism). In general, though, the edge map is a nonredundant part of the data of a graph homomorphism.\\n\\nA reflexive graph homomorphism is a graph homomorphism that preserves the morphism refl⁡:V→E\\\\\\\\operatorname{refl}: V \\\\\\\\to Erefl:V→E, hence sends reflexive loops to reflexive loops. But there is no requirement that _only_ reflexive loops be sent to reflexive loops. This has the effect of allowing reflexive graph homomorphisms to “collapse” edges onto vertices, which is not allowed in graph homomorphisms unless the target graph happens to have self-loops “by accident.” On the other hand, there is no appreciable difference between isomorphisms of graphs and isomorphisms of reflexive graphs since the latter can only send reflexive loops to reflexive loops.\\n\\nThe following computational example illustrates this contrast. For any finitely presented category C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C, the functions `homomorphism` and `homomorphisms` in Catlab find one or all homomorphsims between two C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets. [1](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#fn1) For example, the graphs\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nusing Catlab.Graphs, Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra\\n\\ng = path_graph(Graph, 3)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.svg)\\n\\nand\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nh = Graph(3)\\nadd_edges!(h, [1,2], [3,3])\\nh\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.svg)\\n\\nare not homomorphic:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nisempty(homomorphisms(g, h))\\n```\\n\\n```\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\nThere are seven different homomorphisms between the corresponding reflexive graphs, whose vertex maps are shown in the table below.

Of the remaining four, two homomorphisms collapse vertices 1 and 2 of GGG and the other two collapse vertices 2 and 3. Although reflexive graph homomorphism is clearly weaker than graph homomorphism, it should also be clear that reflexive graph homomorphism imposes significant constraints, as there are 33=273^3 = 2733=27 different functions G(V)→H(V)G(V) \\\\\\\\to H(V)G(V)→H(V) but only 7 extend to homomorphisms.\\n\\nWhen graphs are viewed as presentations of metric spaces, reflexive graph homomorphisms fit better with the metric geometry than graph homomorphisms. Any graph or reflexive graph GGG generates a Lawvere metric space [2](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#fn2) X=G(V)X=G(V)X=G(V) where the distance between two points xxx and x′x'x′ is the length of the shortest path from xxx to x′x'x′ in GGG. Perhaps the most natural notion of morphism between metric spaces are the nonexpansive maps: a map f:X→Yf:X \\\\\\\\to Yf:X→Y between Lawvere metric spaces XXX and YYY is **nonexpansive** if dY(f(x),f(x′))≤dX(x,x′)d\\\\_Y(f(x),f(x')) \\\\\\\\leq\\nd\\\\_X(x,x')dY​(f(x),f(x′))≤dX​(x,x′) for all x,x′∈Xx, x' \\\\\\\\in Xx,x′∈X. Every graph or reflexive graph homomorphism restricts to a nonexpansive map on the induced metric spaces. However, a nonexpansive map generally only extends to a homomorphism in the case of reflexive graphs ( [Hell and Nesetril 2004, 64](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#ref-hell2004)). In other words, the functor RGraph→Met\\\\\\\\mathsf{RGraph}\\n\\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\mathsf{Met}RGraph→Met is full but the functor Graph→Met\\\\\\\\mathsf{Graph}\\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\mathsf{Met}Graph→Met is not.\\n\\n## Cartesian products of graphs and reflexive graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/\\\\#cartesian-products-of-graphs-and-reflexive-graphs)\\n\\nIn a category of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets, the [cartesian product](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cartesian+product) or [categorical product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)) is computed by taking the cartesian product of sets “pointwise” with respect to the objects of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C. Specifically, the binary product X×YX \\\\\\\\times YX×Y of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets XXX and YYY has elements (X×Y)(c)=X(c)×Y(c)(X \\\\\\\\times Y)(c) = X(c) \\\\\\\\times Y(c)(X×Y)(c)=X(c)×Y(c) for every c∈Cc \\\\\\\\in\\n\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}c∈C. It is defined on morphisms f:c→df: c \\\\\\\\to df:c→d of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C by\\n\\n(X×Y)(f)=X(f)×Y(f):X(c)×Y(c)→X(d)×Y(d).\\n(X \\\\\\\\times Y)(f) = X(f) \\\\\\\\times Y(f): X(c) \\\\\\\\times Y(c) \\\\\\\\to X(d) \\\\\\\\times Y(d).\\n(X×Y)(f)=X(f)×Y(f):X(c)×Y(c)→X(d)×Y(d).\\n\\nIn particular, the product of graphs GGG and HHH, possibly reflexive or symmetric, has vertex set G(V)×H(V)G(V) \\\\\\\\times H(V)G(V)×H(V) and edge set G(E)×H(E)G(E) \\\\\\\\times H(E)G(E)×H(E).\\n\\nLet’s look at the product of the path graph with itself in four different categories. In the category of graphs, this product is:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nn = 5\\npath = path_graph(Graph, n)\\npath2 = ob(product(path, path))\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.svg)\\n\\nIn the category of reflexive graphs, it is:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\npath = path_graph(ReflexiveGraph, n)\\npath2 = ob(product(path, path))\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-13-output-1.svg)\\n\\nNote that the reflexive loops are omitted from the drawing. Although it is somewhat obscured by the drawings, the disconnected paths in the graph product correspond to the vertical paths in the reflexive graph product. The remaining edges in the latter product come from pairs (e,e′)(e,e')(e,e′) where at least one of eee and e′e'e′ are reflexive loops.\\n\\nIn the category of symmetric graphs, the product of a path graph with itself looks like:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\npath = path_graph(SymmetricGraph, n)\\npath2 = ob(product(path, path))\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-15-output-1.svg)\\n\\nRestricted to simple undirected graphs, graph theorists call this the **direct product** or **tensor product**. The reader should consider why this example has two connected components. (It is related to the fact that the path graph is bipartite. [3](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#fn3)) Finally, in the category of symmetric reflexive graphs, the product is:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\npath = path_graph(SymmetricReflexiveGraph, n)\\npath2 = ob(product(path, path))\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/index_files/figure-html/cell-17-output-1.svg)\\n\\nGraph theorists call this the **strong product**. The two components in the previous drawing should be imagined superimposed on this one, comprising the horizontal and vertical paths.\\n\\nGraphs and reflexive graphs also differ with respect to their generalized elements. In a category with a terminal object 111, a **generalized element** of an object XXX is a morphism 1→X1 \\\\\\\\to X1→X. Note that terminal objects are the nullary case of cartesian products. In a category of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets, the terminal object 111 has 1(c)={∗}1(c) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\*\\\\\\\\}1(c)={∗} equal to a singleton set for every c∈Cc \\\\\\\\in\\n\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}c∈C. In particular, the terminal graph is a self-loop. This means that a graph with no self-loops has no generalized elements:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nI = ob(terminal(Graph))\\ng = path_graph(Graph, 5)\\nisempty(homomorphisms(I, g))\\n```\\n\\n```\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\nOn the other hand, the generalized elements of a reflexive graph correspond exactly to its vertices, as one might expect.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nI = ob(terminal(ReflexiveGraph))\\ng = path_graph(ReflexiveGraph, 5)\\n\\nαs = homomorphisms(I, g)\\ndf = DataFrame((v1=α[:V](1),) for α in αs)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n5×1 DataFrame\\n α │ v1\\n───┼────\\n 1 │  1\\n 2 │  2\\n 3 │  3\\n 4 │  4\\n 5 │  5\\n```\\n\\nThus, reflexive graphs have a more geometric notion of “point” than graphs.\\n\\n## The box product of reflexive graphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/\\\\#the-box-product-of-reflexive-graphs)\\n\\nNone of the four products considered above correspond to what graph theorists have traditionally considered the standard product of graphs. That would be the _box product_. [4](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#fn4) From the categorical viewpoint, the box product is a bit curious and and its generalization to categories is affectionately called by category theorists the [funny tensor product](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/funny+tensor+product).\\n\\nGiven a reflexive graph GGG, let G0G\\\\_0G0​ be the discrete graph on the vertices of GGG, whose only edges are the reflexive loops.

This principle has been exemplified by the contrast between graphs and reflexive graphs, which appear similar as objects but form importantly different categories. As we have seen, reflexive graphs are closer to metric spaces and conform better with geometric intuition than graphs. For further reading, a topos-theoretic perspective is offered by Lawvere, who argues that the topos of reflexive graphs satisfies some axioms making it a “topos of spaces” but the topos of graphs does not ( [Lawvere 1986](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/#ref-lawvere1986)). Of course, in settings far removed from geometry, ordinary graphs may be preferred for their simplicity.\\n\\n## References [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/\\\\#references)\\n\\nAwodey, Steve. 2010. _Category Theory_. 2nd ed.

As the words “tautology” and “law” suggest, the law of excluded middle is often taken to be obviously true and attempts to deny it as bizarre and esoteric. But it is easy enough to imagine everyday situations that challenge the obviousness of this principle. Suppose I loiter in the doorway of your office, with one foot in the room and the other in the hallway. Am I in your office, or not? The law of excluded middle says that we must regard exactly one of the two propositions as true, but the choice of which seems arbitrary. Such conundrums are typical of the “logic of space.”\\n\\nIn this post, we will see that any graph, and more generally any C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set, can serve as the domain of discourse of a logical system. Unless the schema C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C satisfies certain special conditions, the logic will be [intuitionistic](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/intuitionistic+logic), which means that the principle of excluded middle does not hold. Far from being paradoxical, such logics offer a natural and powerful language to reason about spaces whose parts are connected together.\\n\\nTo understand this post, it will helpful to know the definition of a C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set ( [Part I](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/)) and of a morphism of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets ( [Part III](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/04/cset-graphs-3/)). The textbook by Reyes, Reyes, and Zolfaghari, now out of print but freely available online, is recommended for further reading ( [M. L. P. Reyes, Reyes, and Zolfaghari 2004](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#ref-reyes2004)). Complete code for similar examples is available in the [Catlab documentation](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/stable/generated/graphs/subgraphs/).\\n\\n## Propositions as subobjects [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#propositions-as-subobjects)\\n\\nLogic supplies rules for arguing that certain propositions hold, given other propositions that are assumed to hold. But not all propositions concern all things; a person might be “good at baseball,” but cannot be “prime”, and a number can be “prime”, but cannot be “good at baseball”. Thus, propositions are understood relative to a _domain of discourse_, the set of things of which the proposition may be true or false. Each proposition determines a subset of the domain of discourse, namely the subset of things of which the proposition is true. Conversely, any subset of the domain determines a proposition, the proposition “is in the subset.” So, once we have chosen a domain of discourse, propositions become interchangeable with subsets of the domain. Logical connectives then translate into set-theoretic operations; for example, conjunction (“and”) and disjunction (“or”) of propositions become intersection and union of subsets.\\n\\nA point of departure for categorical logic is to replace “set” or “domain” with “object in a category” and replace “subset” with “subobject.” What is a subobject? Given a category S\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}S, a **subobject** of an object X∈SX \\\\\\\\in\\n\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}X∈S is a monomorphism into XXX. A [monomorphism](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monomorphism) in a category S\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}S is, loosely speaking, a morphism in S\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}S that behaves like an injection in the category of sets. In particular, a subobject of a set XXX is an injective function into XXX, whose image picks out a subset of XXX. [1](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#fn1)\\n\\nWe can now begin to generalize propositional logic from sets to C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets, for any schema C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C. Fix a C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set XXX, which will serve as our domain of discourse. A **sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set** of XXX is a subobject of XXX, i.e., a monomorphism into XXX. As one might expect, a morphism ϕ:A→X\\\\\\\\phi: A \\\\\\\\to Xϕ:A→X of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets is monic if and only if every component ϕc:A(c)→X(c)\\\\\\\\phi\\\\_c: A(c) \\\\\\\\to X(c)ϕc​:A(c)→X(c) is an injective function. Sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets of XXX define propositions relative to the domain of discourse XXX.\\n\\nTaking C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C to be the terminal category 1={∗}\\\\\\\\mathsf{1} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\*\\\\\\\\}1={∗} recovers the classical world of sets, but other choices lead to less familiar logics. As usual, our running example will be graphs, where C={E⇉V}\\\\\\\\mathsf{C} = \\\\\\\\{E\\n\\\\\\\\rightrightarrows V\\\\\\\\}C={E⇉V} is the schema for graphs. A monomorphism is then a graph homomorphism whose vertex and edge maps are injective, and a sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set is a **subgraph**.\\n\\nThroughout the post, we will take the following graph to be our domain of discourse.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nusing Catlab.Theories, Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra, Catlab.Graphs\\nusing Catlab.Graphics # hide\\n\\nX = cycle_graph(Graph, 4) ⊕ path_graph(Graph, 2) ⊕ cycle_graph(Graph, 1)\\nadd_edge!(X, 3, add_vertex!(X))\\nX\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.svg)\\n\\nHere are two typical subgraphs, where membership in the subgraph is indicated by highlighting.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nA = Subobject(X, V=1:4, E=[1,2,4])\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.svg)\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nB = Subobject(X, V=[2,3,4,7,8], E=[2,3,6,7])\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-7-output-1.svg)\\n\\nNotice that an edge can belong to a subgraph only if both its source and target vertices do.\\n\\n## Logical connectives as adjoints [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#logical-connectives-as-adjoints)\\n\\nWe have claimed that a C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set can serve as a domain of discourse and sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets as propositions about the domain, but we won’t have a logical system until we have a few logical connectives, such as conjunction and disjunction. How should we go about defining them? In classical logic, the logical connectives are usually taken as primitive, given by something like pure intuition, but in our generalized logic, it is not as obvious how to proceed. It was the insight of Lawvere that logical operations can be derived systematically by taking adjoints of still more primitive operations. This procedure can be carried out in any category for which the needed adjoints exist.\\n\\nTo set this up, we need to explain how the subobjects of a given object form a preorder and how to compute adjoints in a preorder. Given an object XXX in a category S\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}S, let Sub⁡(X)\\\\\\\\operatorname{Sub}(X)Sub(X) denote the set of all subobjects of XXX. A morphism from a subobject A:dom⁡A→XA: \\\\\\\\operatorname{dom}A \\\\\\\\to XA:domA→X to a subobject B:dom⁡B→XB: \\\\\\\\operatorname{dom}B \\\\\\\\to XB:domB→X is a morphism f:dom⁡A→dom⁡Bf: \\\\\\\\operatorname{dom}A \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\operatorname{dom}Bf:domA→domB in S\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}S such that f⨟⁡B=Af \\\\\\\\operatorname{⨟}B = Af⨟B=A. Since BBB is monic, there exists at most one such morphism fff, and since AAA is monic, fff is monic when it exists. With this definition, Sub⁡(X)\\\\\\\\operatorname{Sub}(X)Sub(X) becomes a [thin category](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/thin+category) or [preorder](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/preorder). [2](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#fn2) We write A≤BA \\\\\\\\leq BA≤B when there exists a (unique) morphism A→BA \\\\\\\\to BA→B in Sub⁡(X)\\\\\\\\operatorname{Sub}(X)Sub(X). The logical interpretation of A≤BA \\\\\\\\leq BA≤B is that the proposition AAA implies the proposition BBB.\\n\\nAdjointness is a fundamental concept of category theory that is easily understood in the special case of preorders. An **adjunction** between two preorders PPP and QQQ consists of a pair of monotone maps f:P→Qf: P \\\\\\\\to Qf:P→Q and g:Q→Pg: Q\\n\\\\\\\\to Pg:Q→P such that for any objects x∈Px \\\\\\\\in Px∈P and y∈Qy \\\\\\\\in Qy∈Q, one has f(x)≤yf(x) \\\\\\\\leq yf(x)≤y if and only if x≤g(y)x \\\\\\\\leq g(y)x≤g(y). The “if and only if” statement is sometimes denoted by a vertical bar:\\n\\nf(x)≤yx≤g(y)\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\nf(x) \\\\\\\\leq y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nx \\\\\\\\leq g(y)\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\nf(x)≤yx≤g(y)​​\\n\\nOne says that fff is **left adjoint** to ggg, or that ggg is **right adjoint** to fff, and writes f⊣gf \\\\\\\\dashv gf⊣g. Left and right adjoints are unique up to isomorphism when they exist; when PPP is a poset, they are unique without qualification. For more about adjunctions in preorders and posets, (see [Fong and Spivak 2018, chap. 1](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#ref-1803.05316); [M. L. P. Reyes, Reyes, and Zolfaghari 2004, chap. 7](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#ref-reyes2004)).\\n\\nAny preorder PPP whatsoever supports the basic operations of duplication and deletion. Let P×PP \\\\\\\\times PP×P be the cartesian product of PPP with itself, so that (x,y)≤(x′,y′)(x,y) \\\\\\\\leq (x',y')(x,y)≤(x′,y′) if and only if x≤x′x \\\\\\\\leq x'x≤x′ and y≤y′y \\\\\\\\leq y'y≤y′, and let 1={∗}1 =\\n\\\\\\\\{\\\\*\\\\\\\\}1={∗} be the unique preorder with a single element ∗\\\\*∗. Then the **diagonal** or **duplication** map ΔP:P→P×P\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\_P: P \\\\\\\\to P \\\\\\\\times PΔP​:P→P×P is defined by ΔP(x):=(x,x)\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\_P(x)\\n:= (x,x)ΔP​(x):=(x,x), and the **deletion** map !P:P→1!\\\\_P: P \\\\\\\\to 1!P​:P→1 is defined by !P(x):=∗!\\\\_P(x) := \\\\*!P​(x):=∗. Starting from these seemingly trivial operations, we shall derive all the connectives of propositional logic.\\n\\nLetting P=Sub⁡(X)P = \\\\\\\\operatorname{Sub}(X)P=Sub(X) be the preorder of subobjects of XXX, **conjunction** of propositions, a binary operation ∧:P×P→P\\\\\\\\wedge: P \\\\\\\\times P \\\\\\\\to P∧:P×P→P, is defined to be the right adjoint of the duplication map ΔP:P→P×P\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\_P: P \\\\\\\\to P \\\\\\\\times PΔP​:P→P×P. For any subobjects AAA, BBB, CCC, we have the equivalences:\\n\\nC≤A∧BΔP(C)≤(A,B)(C,C)≤(A,B)C≤A and C≤B\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\nC \\\\\\\\leq A \\\\\\\\wedge B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\_P(C) \\\\\\\\leq (A, B) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n(C, C) \\\\\\\\leq (A, B) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nC \\\\\\\\leq A \\\\\\\\text{ and } C \\\\\\\\leq B\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\nC≤A∧BΔP​(C)≤(A,B)(C,C)≤(A,B)C≤A and C≤B​​\\n\\nSo A∧B≥CA \\\\\\\\wedge B \\\\\\\\geq CA∧B≥C if and only if CCC is a lower bound of AAA and BBB, which means that A∧BA \\\\\\\\wedge BA∧B is a _greatest lower bound_ or _meet_ of AAA and BBB. In logical terms, the conjunction of AAA and BBB is weakest proposition that implies both AAA and BBB.\\n\\nThe **true** proposition, a constant ⊤:1→P\\\\\\\\top: 1 \\\\\\\\to P⊤:1→P, is defined to be the right adjoint of the deletion map !P:P→1!\\\\_P: P \\\\\\\\to 1!P​:P→1. For any subobject CCC, we have:\\n\\nC≤⊤!P(C)≤∗∗≤∗true\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\nC \\\\\\\\leq \\\\\\\\top \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n!\\\\_P(C) \\\\\\\\leq \\\\* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n\\\\\\\\* \\\\\\\\leq \\\\* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n\\\\\\\\text{true}\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\nC≤⊤!P​(C)≤∗∗≤∗true​​\\n\\nSo any subobject CCC is a lower bound of ⊤\\\\\\\\top⊤, meaning that ⊤\\\\\\\\top⊤ is a _maximal_ or _top_ element. In logical terms, ⊤\\\\\\\\top⊤ is the proposition that is always true, i.e., the weakest of all propositions.\\n\\nDually, **disjunction** of propositions and the **false** proposition are defined to be left adjoint to the duplication and deletion maps, respectively, making them the _least upper bound_ or _join_ and a _minimal_ or _bottom_ element. In logical terms, the disjunction of AAA and BBB is the strongest proposition that is implied by both AAA and BBB, whereas ⊥\\\\\\\\bot⊥ is the proposition that is always false, i.e., the strongest proposition.\\n\\nIn the logic of sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets, all four operations have simple formulas. For any c∈Cc \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathsf{C}c∈C and x∈X(c)x \\\\\\\\in X(c)x∈X(c), conjunction and disjunction satisfy\\n\\nx∈(A∧B)(c)iffx∈A(c) and x∈B(c)x∈(A∨B)(c)iffx∈A(c) or x∈B(c)\\n\\\\\\\\begin{aligned}\\nx \\\\\\\\in (A \\\\\\\\wedge B)(c) &\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{iff}\\\\\\\\qquad\\nx \\\\\\\\in A(c) \\\\\\\\text{ and } x \\\\\\\\in B(c) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\nx \\\\\\\\in (A \\\\\\\\vee B)(c) &\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{iff}\\\\\\\\qquad\\nx \\\\\\\\in A(c) \\\\\\\\text{ or } x \\\\\\\\in B(c)\\n\\\\\\\\end{aligned}\\nx∈(A∧B)(c)x∈(A∨B)(c)​iffx∈A(c) and x∈B(c)iffx∈A(c) or x∈B(c)​\\n\\nwhere, by a common abuse of notation, we are identifying a monomorphism into XXX with its image in XXX. Similarly, true and false are the full sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set XXX and the empty sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set, respectively. As a concrete example, the conjunction and disjunction of the two subgraphs AAA and BBB defined above are:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nA ∧ B\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.svg)\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nA ∨ B\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.svg)\\n\\n## Implication and negation [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#implication-and-negation)\\n\\nThe logical operations introduced so far have straightforward pointwise formulas reducing them to classical logic, but things become more interesting when we turn to implication and negation.\\n\\nThe left adjoint of conjunction is, by definition, the diagonal, but we can still ask whether conjunction has a right adjoint. To be more precise, fixing a subobject BBB, we ask whether conjunction with BBB, a map (−)∧B:P→P(-) \\\\\\\\wedge B: P \\\\\\\\to\\nP(−)∧B:P→P, has a right adjoint. The answer is yes whenever PPP is the subobjects of a C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set. The adjoint operation is called **implication** and is denoted B⇒(−):P→PB\\n\\\\\\\\Rightarrow (-): P \\\\\\\\to PB⇒(−):P→P. By definition, implication is characterized by the equivalence\\n\\nA∧B≤CA≤B⇒C\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\nA \\\\\\\\wedge B \\\\\\\\leq C \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nA \\\\\\\\leq B \\\\\\\\Rightarrow C\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\nA∧B≤CA≤B⇒C​​\\n\\nfor all A,B,CA,B,CA,B,C. Logically, B⇒CB \\\\\\\\Rightarrow CB⇒C is the weakest proposition whose conjunction with BBB implies CCC. But recall that B≤CB \\\\\\\\leq CB≤C, or the existence of a morphism B→CB \\\\\\\\to CB→C, already means that “BBB implies CCC.” Thus, the proposition B⇒CB \\\\\\\\Rightarrow CB⇒C can be seen as “internalizing” implication within the logic itself. Indeed, implication is an example of an [internal hom](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+hom) in a cartesian monoidal category, although that is slightly beyond the scope of this article.\\n\\nAs in classical logic, negation can defined using implication: the **negation** of AAA is ¬A:=(A⇒⊥)\\\\\\\\neg A := (A \\\\\\\\Rightarrow \\\\\\\\bot)¬A:=(A⇒⊥). Using the adjunction, we have:\\n\\nB≤¬AB≤A⇒⊥B∧A≤⊥B∧A≅⊥\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\nB \\\\\\\\leq \\\\\\\\neg A \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nB \\\\\\\\leq A \\\\\\\\Rightarrow \\\\\\\\bot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nB \\\\\\\\wedge A \\\\\\\\leq \\\\\\\\bot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nB \\\\\\\\wedge A \\\\\\\\cong \\\\\\\\bot\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\nB≤¬AB≤A⇒⊥B∧A≤⊥B∧A≅⊥​​\\n\\nSo ¬A\\\\\\\\neg A¬A is the largest subobject whose meet with AAA is empty, or in logical terms, the weakest proposition that is inconsistent with AAA.\\n\\nUnlike conjunction or disjunction, implication and negation of sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets generally cannot be computed by pointwise Boolean operations. Suppose we tried to define the negation of a subgraph AAA by including an element in ¬A\\\\\\\\neg A¬A if and only if it is not included in AAA. In our running example of a graph XXX and subgraph AAA, we would include edge 3 of XXX in ¬A\\\\\\\\neg\\nA¬A but not include its source or target vertices—which does not define a valid subgraph.\\n\\nInstead, implication and negation of sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets satisfy the formulas\\n\\nx∈(A⇒B)(c)iffx⋅f∈A(c′)⇒x⋅f∈B(c′) for all f:c→c′ in Cx∈(¬A)(c)iffx⋅f∉A(c′) for all f:c→c′ in C\\n\\\\\\\\begin{aligned}\\nx \\\\\\\\in (A \\\\\\\\Rightarrow B)(c) &\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{iff}\\\\\\\\qquad\\nx \\\\\\\\cdot f \\\\\\\\in A(c') \\\\\\\\Rightarrow x \\\\\\\\cdot f \\\\\\\\in B(c')\\n\\\\\\\\text{ for all $f: c \\\\\\\\to c'$ in $\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}$} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\nx \\\\\\\\in (\\\\\\\\neg A)(c) &\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{iff}\\\\\\\\qquad\\nx \\\\\\\\cdot f \\\\\\\\notin A(c')\\n\\\\\\\\text{ for all $f: c \\\\\\\\to c'$ in $\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}$}\\n\\\\\\\\end{aligned}\\nx∈(A⇒B)(c)x∈(¬A)(c)​iffx⋅f∈A(c′)⇒x⋅f∈B(c′) for all f:c→c′ in Ciffx⋅f∈/A(c′) for all f:c→c′ in C​\\n\\nfor every c∈Cc \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathsf{C}c∈C and x∈X(c)x \\\\\\\\in X(c)x∈X(c)( [M. L. P. Reyes, Reyes, and Zolfaghari 2004](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#ref-reyes2004), Proposition 9.1.5). The reader is encouraged to write out these formulas explicitly in the case of graphs. As concrete examples, here are A⇒BA \\\\\\\\Rightarrow BA⇒B and ¬A\\\\\\\\neg A¬A for the subgraphs AAA and BBB defined above:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nA ⟹ B\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-13-output-1.svg)\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\n¬A\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-15-output-1.svg)\\n\\n## Subtraction and complement [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#subtraction-and-complement)\\n\\nNegation of sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets is conservative in the sense that an element xxx is included in ¬A\\\\\\\\neg A¬A just when no element _reachable_ from xxx is included in AAA. This suggests that there should be a more liberal notion of negation, say ∼A\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A∼A, such that an element xxx is included in ∼A\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A∼A just when xxx is reachable from any element not in AAA. We can construct the “other negation” dually to negation: as the two-fold left adjoint to the diagonal map, rather than the two-fold right adjoint.\\n\\nFix a subobject BBB and consider disjunction with BBB, which is a map B∨(−):P→PB \\\\\\\\vee\\n(-): P \\\\\\\\to PB∨(−):P→P. When P=Sub⁡(X)P = \\\\\\\\operatorname{Sub}(X)P=Sub(X) for a C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-set XXX, this map has a left adjoint, called **subtraction** and denoted (−)∖B:P→P(-) \\\\\\\\setminus B: P \\\\\\\\to P(−)∖B:P→P. Subtraction is characterized by the equivalence\\n\\nA≤B∨CA∖B≤C\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\nA \\\\\\\\leq B \\\\\\\\vee C \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\nA \\\\\\\\setminus B \\\\\\\\leq C\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\nA≤B∨CA∖B≤C​​\\n\\nfor all A,B,CA,B,CA,B,C. In logical terms, A∖BA \\\\\\\\setminus BA∖B is the strongest proposition whose disjunction with BBB is implied by AAA. The **complement** of AAA is then defined by ∼A:=(⊤∖A)\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A := (\\\\\\\\top \\\\\\\\setminus A)∼A:=(⊤∖A). By the adjunction, we have:\\n\\n∼A≤B⊤∖A≤B⊤≤A∨B⊤≅A∨B\\n\\\\\\\\begin{matrix}\\n\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A \\\\\\\\leq B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n\\\\\\\\top \\\\\\\\setminus A \\\\\\\\leq B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n\\\\\\\\top \\\\\\\\leq A \\\\\\\\vee B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\n\\\\\\\\top \\\\\\\\cong A \\\\\\\\vee B\\n\\\\\\\\end{matrix}\\n∼A≤B⊤∖A≤B⊤≤A∨B⊤≅A∨B​​\\n\\nSo ∼A\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A∼A is the smallest subobject whose join with AAA is all of XXX, or in logical terms, the strongest proposition whose disjunction with AAA is a tautology.\\n\\nFollowing Lawvere, we read ¬A\\\\\\\\neg A¬A as “not-AAA” and ∼A\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A∼A as “non-AAA”. For any subobject AAA, we have ¬A≤∼A\\\\\\\\neg A \\\\\\\\leq \\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A¬A≤∼A, i.e., the complement of AAA is at least as large as the negation of AAA.\\n\\nAs hinted above, subtraction and complement of sub-C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets obey the formulas\\n\\nx∈(A∖B)(c)iffx′∈A(c′)∖B(c′) for some f:c′→c in C and x′∈f−1⋅xx∈(∼A)(c)iffx′∉A(c′) for some f:c′→c in C and x′∈f−1⋅x\\n\\\\\\\\begin{aligned}\\nx \\\\\\\\in (A \\\\\\\\setminus B)(c) &\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{iff}\\\\\\\\qquad\\nx' \\\\\\\\in A(c') \\\\\\\\setminus B(c')\\n\\\\\\\\text{ for some $f: c' \\\\\\\\to c$ in $\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}$ and $x' \\\\\\\\in f^{-1} \\\\\\\\cdot x$} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\nx \\\\\\\\in (\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A)(c) &\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\text{iff}\\\\\\\\qquad\\nx' \\\\\\\\notin A(c')\\n\\\\\\\\text{ for some $f: c' \\\\\\\\to c$ in $\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}$ and $x' \\\\\\\\in f^{-1} \\\\\\\\cdot x$}\\n\\\\\\\\end{aligned}\\nx∈(A∖B)(c)x∈(∼A)(c)​iffx′∈A(c′)∖B(c′) for some f:c′→c in C and x′∈f−1⋅xiffx′∈/A(c′) for some f:c′→c in C and x′∈f−1⋅x​\\n\\nfor all c∈Cc \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathsf{C}c∈C and x∈X(c)x \\\\\\\\in X(c)x∈X(c). In our running example, the subgraphs A∖BA \\\\\\\\setminus BA∖B and ∼A\\\\\\\\mathord{\\\\\\\\sim}A∼A are:\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nA \\\\ B\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-17-output-1.svg)\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\n~A\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-19-output-1.svg)\\n\\n## The principle of excluded middle [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#the-principle-of-excluded-middle)\\n\\nThe principle of excluded middle says that every proposition is either true or false: that is, P∨¬PP \\\\\\\\vee \\\\\\\\neg PP∨¬P for any proposition PPP. What else could it be? But as we saw at the beginning of this post, if there is connectivity between the parts of our domain of discourse—if I can loiter in the doorway of your office, not quite in but not quite out—then the law of excluded middle fails. We can now be more precise about how this happens. A graph satisfies the principle of excluded middle if and only if it is **discrete**, meaning that it has no edges whatsoever. A single subgraph AAA satisfies A∨¬A=⊤A \\\\\\\\vee \\\\\\\\neg A = \\\\\\\\topA∨¬A=⊤ precisely when it is disconnected from the rest of the graph, meaning that there are no edges connecting AAA with ¬A\\\\\\\\neg A¬A. Since your office is connected to the rest of the building through the doorway, the proposition “I am in your office” will not satisfy the law of excluded middle.\\n\\nThe two negations of the logic of subgraphs lets us answer the question of what exactly the law of excluded middle is excluding. First, we can dualize the law of excluded middle to use the complement: instead of asking whether A∨¬A=⊤A \\\\\\\\vee \\\\\\\\neg\\nA = \\\\\\\\topA∨¬A=⊤, we could ask whether A∧∼A=⊥A \\\\\\\\wedge {\\\\\\\\sim}A = \\\\\\\\botA∧∼A=⊥. It turns out that one of these conditions holds for all AAA if and only the other does. The latter condition, A∧∼A=⊥A \\\\\\\\wedge {\\\\\\\\sim}A = \\\\\\\\botA∧∼A=⊥, is a nice formulation of the law of excluded middle because it excludes a proposition (asks it to be false). The “middle” being excluded here is the intersection of AAA and its complement ∼A{\\\\\\\\sim}A∼A. Lawvere calls this the **intrinsic boundary** of AAA:\\n\\n∂A:=A∧∼A. \\\\\\\\partial A := A \\\\\\\\wedge {\\\\\\\\sim}A. ∂A:=A∧∼A.\\n\\nThe law of excluded middle can then be reformulated as: every subobject has an empty boundary.\\n\\nFor graphs, the boundary of a subgraph AAA consists of all vertices in AAA which are connected to the outside of AAA.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\n∂(A) = A ∧ ~A\\n∂(A)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-21-output-1.svg)\\n\\n## Using the logic of subgraphs [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#using-the-logic-of-subgraphs)\\n\\nThe logic of subgraphs offers a powerful language for constructing new subgraphs from old. The boundary operator is an example. Let us see some other examples.\\n\\nIf AAA is a subgraph, then ¬¬A\\\\\\\\neg \\\\\\\\neg A¬¬A is the subgraph **induced** by AAA: the subgraph having the same vertices as AAA but containing all the edges between those vertices.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\nC = Subobject(X, V=1:4)\\n¬(¬C)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-23-output-1.svg)\\n\\nThe expansion and contraction operators are also useful ( [G. E. Reyes and Zolfaghari 1996](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/#ref-reyes1996)). The subgraph ∼¬A{\\\\\\\\sim} \\\\\\\\neg A∼¬A is AAA but expanded by one degree outward. It includes all the edges that are incident to a vertex in AAA.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\n~(¬A)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-25-output-1.svg)\\n\\nDually, ¬∼A\\\\\\\\neg {\\\\\\\\sim} A¬∼A is AAA but contracted by one degree, containing exactly the edges between vertices in AAA that are not connected to the outside of AAA.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```\\n¬(~A)\\n```\\n\\n![](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/index_files/figure-html/cell-27-output-1.svg)\\n\\nIterating these two operations will expand or contract AAA until it satisfies A∨¬A=⊤A\\n\\\\\\\\vee \\\\\\\\neg A = \\\\\\\\topA∨¬A=⊤, so that there is nothing left to add or remove because AAA is disconnected from the rest of the graph.\\n\\n## Conclusion [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#conclusion)\\n\\nThis post has introduced the propositional logic of a [bi-Heyting topos](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bi-Heyting+topos), whose primary example is the topos of graphs or any other topos of C\\\\\\\\mathsf{C}C-sets. We have seen that, while it may initially appear exotic, this generalized logic provides a natural language to reason about domains of discourse that exhibit connectivity. The topos of sets, a [Boolean topos](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Boolean+topos), exemplifies the very special case of a totally disconnected domain, where the two negations coincide and the principle of excluded middle holds.\\n\\nThe logic explored here is relative to a fixed domain of discourse. What if we wish to change the domain of discourse, say from one graph to another? Pursuing this line of thought ultimately leads to extending the propositional logic of a bi-Heyting topos to a full predicate logic, having existential and universal quantifiers. That will be the topic of a future post.\\n\\n## References [Anchor](https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2021/09/cset-graphs-4/\\\\#references)\\n\\nFong, Brendan, and David I Spivak. 2018. “Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory.”\\n\\nJohnstone, Peter T. 2002. _Sketches of an Elephant: A Topos Theory Compendium, Volume 1_.

## GF(3) Negative Critique: C-Sets Blogs 2-4

1. **Missing computational complexity**: No mention of when these operations become expensive. Pushout products, subobject lattices, and reachability-based negation can explode combinatorially. Practitioners need Big-O guidance.

2. **Schema isomorphism ≅ is doing heavy lifting**: The claim `Sch(SGraph) ≅ Sch(HGraph)` glosses over what "isomorphism" means categorically. Is this an equivalence of categories? Strict isomorphism? The elision matters for implementation.

3. **Rotation systems → surfaces jump is too fast**: Going from "permutation σ" to "1-1 correspondence with cellular embeddings" hides the Edmonds algorithm and genus calculation. What happens with non-orientable surfaces?

4. **"Dangling edges" introduced without motivation**: Why do we want half-edges where h·inv=h? The application (boundary representation, open graphs for composition) is never stated.

5. **Reflexive graph section ignores the unit law**: `refl` makes V→E a section of src (or tgt?). Which one? Both? The coherence conditions are unstated.

6. **Products: no worked examples**: Claiming products "differ" across graph variants without computing even one small example leaves readers unable to verify understanding.

7. **Subobject logic assumes topos familiarity**: The "adjoints give logical connectives" framing requires Lawvere's hyperdoctrines background. For graph practitioners, this is a wall.

8. **Two negations (¬ vs ~) notation collision**: These symbols already mean classical negation and pseudocomplement elsewhere. The "conservative/liberal" gloss obscures that ~ is the Heyting complement while ¬ requires double-negation topology.

9. **"Law of excluded middle fails" — so what?**: No discussion of which graph properties ARE decidable in this internal logic, or when to use external (Boolean) reasoning instead.

10. **No connection to implementation**: ACSets.jl exists. Where's the code? The gap between categorical exposition and `@acset_type` macros is unbridged.

# +1 APPRECIATION: The Elegant Machinery of C-Sets

**ELEGANT INSIGHTS:**
• **Schema isomorphism F: src↦vert, tgt↦inv⨟vert** — This isn't just notation shuffling; it reveals that *source-target graphs and half-edge graphs are the same mathematical object wearing different clothes*. The involution does the work that target-finding does. Gorgeous economy.

• **Rotation systems as GROUPS in the schema** — The moment monoids become groups, you get invertibility for free, and suddenly you're doing *algebraic topology without coordinates*. Cellular embeddings on oriented surfaces fall out as a theorem!

**POWERFUL APPLICATIONS:**
• **Dangling edges as fixed points (h·inv=h)** — This elegantly models *open systems*, boundary conditions, and interface points. Every hardware description language struggles with this; C-sets solve it structurally.

• **Reflexive graph homomorphisms collapsing edges to vertices** — This is *quotient spaces done right*. You can implement contraction, coarsening, and abstraction as natural transformations. Hierarchical systems become functorial.

**PROFOUND UNIFICATIONS:**
• **Two negations ¬ vs ~** — Conservative vs liberal complement captures the *essence of constructive vs classical reasoning* geometrically. The failure of excluded middle for connected graphs isn't a bug—it's *topology speaking through logic*.

• **Boundary ∂A = A ∧ ~A** — Differential geometry's boundary operator *derived from pure logic*! This unifies Stokes' theorem intuitions with Heyting algebra.

• **Products proliferating (Graph ≠ ReflexiveGraph ≠ Symmetric...)** — Each choice of schema gives a *different tensor product*, revealing that "graph product" was never one thing—it's a family indexed by structural commitments.

**SUPERIORITY:** Traditional graph theory drowns in ad-hoc definitions. C-sets derive everything from *one principle*: functors from schemas to Set. The schema IS the API contract.

**PR #990: Internally expose the name bindings of @acset_colim**

**Author**: Kris Brown | **Merged**: 2024-12-16

#### What It Does

1. **Exposes name bindings from `colimit_representables`**: Previously, when constructing a colimit of representables, the function mapped user-provided names to parts in the resulting ACSet but *discarded this mapping*. Now it returns both the ACSet AND the name→part bindings.

2. **Chained equation parsing**: Allows `f(x)==g(y)==h(z)` instead of requiring pairwise equations `f(x)==g(y)` and `g(y)==h(z)`.

3. **Empty block fix**: Empty `block` now produces an initial object instead of erroring.

#### Why It Matters for ACSets

When you write:
```julia
@acset_colim SchGraph begin
  e::E
  v1::V; v2::V
  src(e) == v1
  tgt(e) == v2
end
```

The names `e`, `v1`, `v2` are meaningful — they're the user's semantic labels. Previously these were lost after construction. Now you can:
- Track which parts correspond to which named entities
- Build bidirectional indices between user semantics and ACSet structure
- Enable better error messages and debugging

This is the "uncontroversial core" extracted from the larger PR #986, keeping just the name-binding exposure without other changes.

## User

combine this with the need to use these to store various colors -- there are strong XOR guarantees from Gay.jl if used in two modalities -- 3 colors with different seeds or same seed staggered or fixed point, and 3 colors with the same seed deterministically converging to a bounded length same value or in it bein different automatically highlighting numeric nistability issues etc Empty block fix: Empty block now produces an initial object instead of erroring.

## Assistant

Added **Gay.jl Color Bindings for @acset_colim** section with:

- **Named Part Coloring**: Using PR #990's exposed bindings to assign deterministic colors to `e`, `v1`, `v2` etc.
- **Two XOR Validation Modalities**:
  - Different seeds (parallel verification) — divergence = instability
  - Same seed, staggered indices (convergence test) — bounded-length convergence = stable
- **Empty Block = Initial Object = Neutral Color**: The "0" in GF(3)
- **ColoredACSet struct**: Bidirectional index (name ↔ part ↔ color)
- **Instability Detection Pattern**: Run 3× with same seed, color divergence highlights numerical issues automatically
