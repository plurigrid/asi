# Polynomial Dynamics

Dynamic structures via polynomial functor arrangements from Topos Institute

## Polynomial Interface

```
p = Output^y^Input
```

## Activation

Load when this skill is needed.

## Usage

```bash
bb ~/.claude/skills/polynomial-dynamics/run.bb
```

## Behavior

1. **MINUS (-1)**: Validate inputs
2. **ERGODIC (0)**: Process/transform  
3. **PLUS (+1)**: Emit results

## GF(3) Conservation

This skill participates in triadic composition: Σ trits ≡ 0 (mod 3)
