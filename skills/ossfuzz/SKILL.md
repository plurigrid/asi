## SDF Interleaving

### Primary Chapter: 3. Variations on an Arithmetic Theme

**Concepts**: generic arithmetic, coercion, symbolic, numeric

### GF(3) Balanced Triad

```
ossfuzz (−) + SDF.Ch3 (○) + [balancer] (+) = 0
```

**Skill Trit**: -1 (MINUS - verification)


### Connection Pattern

Generic arithmetic crosses type boundaries. This skill handles heterogeneous data.
