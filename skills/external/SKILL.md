# External Skill

**Status**: Placeholder
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

This skill provides an interface for external system integration and is used to manage connections to external resources that are not part of the core music-topos system.

## Purpose

- Facilitate integration with external systems
- Manage external resource references
- Provide extensibility points for custom integrations

## Usage

This is a framework skill for extension purposes. Specific external integrations should be built on top of this base skill.

## Status

🔄 **In Development** - Framework ready for integration implementations




## Scientific Skill Interleaving

This skill connects to the K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills ecosystem:

### Graph Theory
- **networkx** [○] via bicomodule
  - Universal graph hub

### Bibliography References

- `general`: 734 citations in bib.duckdb

## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Adj
Color: #26D826
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
