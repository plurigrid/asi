# Cider Clojure Skill

**Status**: Stub
**Trit**: 1 (PLUS - additive REPL interaction)

## Overview

CIDER integration for Clojure development with nREPL.

## Commands

- `cider-jack-in` - Start nREPL and connect
- `cider-eval-defun-at-point` - Evaluate current form
- `cider-eval-buffer` - Evaluate entire buffer

## Integration

Works with `borkdude` skill for babashka and `clj-kondo-3color` for linting.



## Scientific Skill Interleaving

This skill connects to the K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills ecosystem:

### Graph Theory
- **networkx** [○] via bicomodule
  - Universal graph hub

### Bibliography References

- `general`: 734 citations in bib.duckdb

## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Adj
Color: #26D826
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
