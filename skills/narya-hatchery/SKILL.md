## Overview

**Narya** is a proof assistant implementing Multi-Modal, Multi-Directional, Higher/Parametric/Displayed Observational Type Theory.

## Core Features

- **Normalization-by-evaluation** algorithm and typechecker
- **Observational-style theory** with Id/Bridge types satisfying parametricity
- **Variable arity and internality** for bridge types
- **User-definable mixfix notations**
- **Record types, inductive datatypes, coinductive codatatypes**
- **Matching and comatching case trees**
- **Import/export and separate compilation**
- **Typed holes** with later solving
- **ProofGeneral interaction mode**

## Type Theory Features

### Bridge Types with Parametricity

```narya
-- Observational identity via bridges
bridge : (A : Type) → (x y : A) → Bridge x y → x ≡ y
```

### Higher-Dimensional Structure

Narya supports higher-dimensional type theory where:
- Types can have internal dimensions
- Parametricity is built into the type theory
- Bridge types generalize equality

## Gay.jl Integration

```julia
# Initialize with Narya's chromatic seed
gay_seed!(0xbfe738ce2e1c5f1f)

# P3 extension gamut learning
function loss(params, seed, target_gamut=:p3_extension)
    color = forward_color(params, projection, seed)
    return out_of_gamut_distance(color, target_gamut)
end
```

## Installation

```bash
# From source
