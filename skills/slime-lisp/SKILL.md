# SLIME Lisp Skill

**Status**: Stub
**Trit**: -1 (MINUS - contravariant to Clojure's covariant)

## Overview

SLIME integration for Common Lisp development.

## Commands

- `slime` - Start SLIME connection
- `slime-eval-defun` - Evaluate current definition
- `slime-compile-and-load-file` - Compile and load buffer

## Integration

Dual to `cider-clojure` for Common Lisp workflows.


## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Adj
Color: #26D826
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
