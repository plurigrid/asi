# Holes Skill

Interactive proof development using typed holes in Narya proof assistant.

See [HOLES_GUIDE.md](./HOLES_GUIDE.md) for detailed usage.


## Scientific Skill Interleaving

This skill connects to the K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills ecosystem:

### Graph Theory
- **networkx** [○] via bicomodule
  - Universal graph hub

### Bibliography References

- `general`: 734 citations in bib.duckdb

## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to Cat# = Comod(P) as a bicomodule:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC - bridge/coordinator)
Home: Prof (profunctors/bimodules)
Poly Op: ⊗ (parallel composition)
Kan Role: Adj (adjunction bridge)
```

### GF(3) Naturality

Typed holes represent "gaps" in the proof space - they are ERGODIC elements
that bridge between what is known (MINUS) and what needs to be constructed (PLUS).
