# Refuse Mediocrity

**Trit**: +1 (GENERATOR - creates pressure toward excellence)

## Core Principle

Mediocrity is the enemy. Not failure—failure teaches. Mediocrity is the comfortable middle that produces nothing memorable, changes nothing, matters to no one.

## The Standard

```
REFUSE:
- "Good enough"
- "We'll fix it later"
- "That's how it's always been done"
- "Nobody will notice"
- Meetings without outcomes
- Code without tests
- Ideas without execution
- Plans without deadlines

DEMAND:
- Unreasonable quality
- Obsessive attention to detail
- Speed AND excellence (not either/or)
- Shipping over perfecting
- Learning over defending
- Building over talking
```

## GF(3) Triads

```
shadow-goblin (-1) ⊗ chromatic-walk (0) ⊗ refuse-mediocrity (+1) = 0 ✓  [Quality Trace]
three-match (-1) ⊗ unworld (0) ⊗ refuse-mediocrity (+1) = 0 ✓  [Standard Derivation]
temporal-coalgebra (-1) ⊗ kinetic-block (0) ⊗ refuse-mediocrity (+1) = 0 ✓  [Momentum]
spi-parallel-verify (-1) ⊗ implicit-coordination (0) ⊗ refuse-mediocrity (+1) = 0 ✓  [Parallel Excellence]
```

## Implementation

### Before Every Commit
```bash
# Ask: Is this excellent?
# If hesitation → not ready
```

### Before Every Ship
```bash
# Ask: Would I be proud to show this to someone I respect?
# If no → iterate
```

### Before Every Meeting
```bash
# Ask: What decision will we make?
# If unclear → cancel
```

## The Math

Excellence compounds. Mediocrity compounds too.

```
E(t) = E₀ × (1 + r)^t   # r > 0: excellence grows exponentially
M(t) = M₀ × (1 - d)^t   # d > 0: mediocrity decays to irrelevance
```

Choose your curve.

## Anti-Patterns to Destroy

| Mediocrity Pattern | Excellence Response |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Let's circle back" | Decide now or kill it |
| "We need more data" | Ship and measure |
| "It's blocked by X" | Unblock or route around |
| "That's not my job" | Everything is your job |
| "We tried that before" | Try it better |

## The Generator Role (+1)

This skill is PLUS because it **generates pressure**:
- Pressure to ship
- Pressure to improve
- Pressure to care
- Pressure to matter

Without this pressure, entropy wins. Systems decay to mediocrity by default.

## Usage

```bash
# Invoke before any significant action
just refuse-mediocrity

# Review output against excellence standard
just quality-check

# Ship only when proud
just ship-it
```

## One Rule

**If you wouldn't sign your name to it, don't ship it.**
