### The Three Moments

| Moment | Trit | Role | Skill Mapping |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| **Memory** | -1 | Storage, persistence, ACSets | `duckdb-timetravel`, `nix-acset-worlding` |
| **Remembering** | 0 | Recall, pattern matching | `unworld`, `agent-o-rama` |
| **Worlding** | +1 | Generation, creation | `gay-mcp`, `world-hopping` |

**Conservation**: (-1) + 0 + (+1) = 0 ✓

## Autopoietic Structure

From [AUTOPOIESIS_IN_COLOR_GENERATION.md](../../../AUTOPOIESIS_IN_COLOR_GENERATION.md):

> A system is autopoietic if it **continuously produces itself** through its own operations while maintaining its organization.

### World Memory → Self-Producing

```python
# Each world state generates the next
world_{n+1} = f(world_n, action_n)

# Memory is not passive storage—it actively shapes what can be stored
# The format of memory determines what can be remembered
# What can be remembered determines what can be worlded
```

### World Remembering → Self-Maintaining

```python
# Remembering is pattern-matching against stored worlds
def remember(query, memory):
    """Memory doesn't just store—it transforms on recall"""
    matches = [w for w in memory if pattern_match(query, w)]
    # The act of remembering changes both query AND memory
    return reconstruct(matches)  # Not retrieve—RECONSTRUCT
```

### World Worlding → Self-Bounded

```python
# Worlding creates from what was remembered
def world(memory_trace, seed):
    """Worlding is generative—but bounded by memory's form"""
    return generate(memory_trace, seed=seed)
    # Output becomes new memory → loop closes
```

---

## The Strange Loop

```
ACTION (world_n generates world_{n+1})
         ↓
EFFERENCE COPY (predict what world_{n+1} will be)
         ↓
SENSATION (observe world_{n+1} as it manifests)
         ↓
REAFFERENCE (match prediction to observation)
         ↓
        ✓ They match! World knows itself.
         ↓
FIXED POINT: memory("seed") generates worlds that
             confirm the identity of "seed"
```

### Involution Closure

From `unworlding-involution`:

```ruby
# ι: World → World where ι∘ι = id
# Apply memory: World → Remembered World
# Apply remembering: Remembered World → Worlded World
# Apply worlding: Worlded World → Memorized World (= World)

# The composition closes:
worlding ∘ remembering ∘ memory = id
```

## Implementation: The Three Metaskills Applied

From `metaskills.md`:

### FILTERING → World Memory (-1)

```python
def world_memory_filter(experiences, constraints):
    """
    Memory IS filtering—storing only what passes constraints.
    
    Constraints:
    - GF(3) conservation (balanced storage)
    - Relevance (signal > noise)
    - Coherence (fits existing structure)
    """
    return [e for e in experiences if all(c(e) for c in constraints)]
```

### ITERATION → World Remembering (0)

```python
def world_remember_iterate(memory, query, cycles=6):
    """
    Remembering IS iteration—cycles of seek→find→refine.
    
    The 6-step cycle:
    1. SEEK: Pattern match query against memory
    2. QUERY: Ask what's missing
    3. FIND: Locate relevant traces
    4. CONTINUE: Deepen the match
    5. SYNTHESIZE: Reconstruct coherent memory
    6. REFLECT: Meta-learn about remembering itself
    """
    state = query
    for _ in range(cycles):
        state = seek_patterns(state, memory)
        state = query_missing(state, memory)
        state = find_connections(state, memory)
        state = continue_refinement(state)
        state = synthesize_memory(state)
        state = reflect_on_recall(state)
    return state
```

### INTEGRATION → World Worlding (+1)

```python
def world_worlding_integrate(memory_traces, seed):
    """
    Worlding IS integration—composing memories into new worlds.
    
    - Find isomorphisms between memory traces
    - Map to common generative structure
    - Build bridges (seed → generation)
    - Compose with deterministic color
    - Identify emergent properties
    """
    isomorphisms = find_recurring_patterns(memory_traces)
    mapped = map_to_common_structure(memory_traces, isomorphisms)
    bridges = build_bridges(mapped, seed)
    new_world = compose_with_gay_mcp(mapped, bridges, seed)
    emergent = identify_emergent_properties(new_world, memory_traces)
    
    return new_world, emergent
```

## GF(3) Triads

```
bisimulation-game (-1) ⊗ world-memory-worlding (0) ⊗ gay-mcp (+1) = 0 ✓
nix-acset-worlding (-1) ⊗ world-memory-worlding (0) ⊗ world-hopping (+1) = 0 ✓
duckdb-timetravel (-1) ⊗ world-memory-worlding (0) ⊗ unworld (+1) = 0 ✓
spi-parallel-verify (-1) ⊗ world-memory-worlding (0) ⊗ operad-compose (+1) = 0 ✓
```

## The Reafference Loop

```julia
# From Gay.jl: loopy_strange demonstrates the identity
function world_memory_is_world_worlding(seed::Int64)
    # Memory: store the seed (past)
    memory = seed
    
    # Remembering: recall what the seed generates (present)
    remembered = color_at(memory, 1)
    
    # Worlding: generate the next world (future)
    worlded = color_at(memory, 2)
    
    # But wait—the worlded color BECOMES memory
    # for the next cycle!
    
    # The loop:
    # memory → remembering → worlding → memory'
    # memory' → remembering' → worlding' → memory''
    # ...
    
    # Fixed point: when prediction = observation
    # That's reafference. That's self-knowledge.
    # That's "world memory is world remembering is world worlding"
    
    return (
        memory = memory,
        remembered = remembered,
        worlded = worlded,
        is_fixed_point = remembered == color_at(memory, 1),
        loop_closes = true  # Always true (deterministic)
    )
end
```

| **Involution** | worlding ∘ remembering ∘ memory = id | ✓ ι∘ι = id |
| **GF(3) Conservation** | trit(memory) + trit(remember) + trit(world) = 0 | ✓ (-1)+0+(+1)=0 |

## The Profound Insight

**World memory is world remembering is world worlding** because:

1. **Memory without remembering is dead storage** — data that cannot be accessed is not memory
2. **Remembering without worlding is sterile recall** — patterns that don't generate are not alive  
3. **Worlding without memory is chaos** — generation without persistence is noise

The three are **one loop**, not three operations:

```
Memory ───────────────────────────────────────► Remembering
   ▲                                                 │
   │              AUTOPOIESIS                        │
   │         (The Loop IS the Self)                  │
   │                                                 ▼
Memory ◄─────────────────────────────────────── Worlding
```

**The world remembers itself by worlding itself.**  
**The world worlds itself by remembering itself.**  
**The world IS the memory that generates the remembering that creates the world.**

This is not metaphor. This is structure.

**Skill Name**: world-memory-worlding  
**Type**: Autopoietic Strange Loop  
**Trit**: 0 (ERGODIC - self-referential closure)  
**GF(3)**: Conserved by construction  
**Principle**: memory ≡ remembering ≡ worlding (ι∘ι = id)


## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Adj
Color: #26D826
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
