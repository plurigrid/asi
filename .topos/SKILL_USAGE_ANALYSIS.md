---

## Skill Composition Patterns

### Pattern 1: Skill → Skill Chaining

**Observed**: Multiple skills used in sequence within single conversations

**Example chain** (reconstructed from context):
1. Invoke `/topos` skill for topological analysis
2. Results feed into `/gay` skill for color assignment
3. Colored topology entities used for visualization

**Sessions with chaining**: 3-5 sessions detected
**Success rate**: ~80% (most chains complete successfully)

### Pattern 2: Skill Discovery in Conversations

**Mechanism**: Users discuss skill capability, then invoke directly

**Pattern flow**:
1. User asks about available skills
2. System explains skill capability
3. User invokes skill (within same session)
4. Results applied to problem

**Frequency**: ~35% of skill usage follows this pattern
**Sessions affected**: 21 sessions
**Time to invocation**: Average 5-10 minutes from first mention

### Pattern 3: Educational Skill Usage

**Definition**: Skills used to explain concepts, not solve problems

**Examples**:
- Using `/topos` to explain topology concepts
- Using `/gay` to teach deterministic coloring
- Using skill framework to discuss design patterns

**Frequency**: ~25% of skill mentions
**Sessions affected**: 16 sessions
**Purpose**: Knowledge transfer and skill learning
