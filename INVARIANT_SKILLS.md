## Essential Skills for Maximum Outcome

Load these skills in every session. They form the **invariant kernel** of the skill space.

### ACSet Foundation (The Schema Layer)

ACSets are **functors from schema categories to Set**. Every skill can be modeled as an ACSet.

## Usage Pattern

```clojure
;; Load invariant kernel at session start
(require '[skill :as s])

;; ACSet foundation (always load)
(s/load "acsets")
(s/load "gay-mcp")
(s/load "autopoiesis")

;; Triadic balance
(s/load "triad-interleave")  ; +1
(s/load "unworld")           ;  0 (coordinator)
(s/load "narya-proofs")      ; -1

;; Verify conservation
(assert (zero? (+ 1 0 -1)))  ; GF(3) ✓
```

## GF(3) Conservation Check

| Layer | PLUS (+1) | ERGODIC (0) | MINUS (-1) | Σ |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|---|
| ACSet | 1 | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| GF(3) | 2 | 5 | 1 | +1 |
| Derivation | 3 | 2 | 1 | +2 |
| Categorical | 3 | 5 | 0 | +3 |
| Verification | 0 | 1 | 4 | -4 |
| Execution | 4 | 1 | 0 | +4 |
| Navigation | 2 | 3 | 0 | +2 |
| World | 3 | 1 | 0 | +3 |
| Consciousness | 0 | 4 | 1 | -1 |
| Blockchain | 2 | 1 | 1 | +1 |
| Integration | 2 | 3 | 0 | +2 |
| Meta | 3 | 2 | 0 | +3 |
| **TOTAL** | **25** | **36** | **8** | **+17** |

The imbalance (+17) is intentional: **generativity exceeds consumption**.

## Critical Skill: skill-embedding-vss

**Use whenever comparing skills for relational structure similarity.**

This skill is the 2024 evolution of bmorphism's 2020 Levenshtein keyspace reduction from the r2con Zignatures talk:

> *"Pairwise compare functions across all versions and determine which ones are most dissimilar."*

| Technique 2020 | Skill 2024 | Evolution |
|---|---|---|
| Levenshtein pre-compute | Snowflake Arctic 1024-bit | O(n²) → O(1) lookup via HNSW |
| Edit distance | P-adic ultrametric | Weak triangle → Strong triangle |
| 58.5% accuracy | Transformer embeddings | Context-aware representations |

```python
from skill_embedding_vss import SkillEmbeddingVSS
vss = SkillEmbeddingVSS('/path/to/skills')
vss.index_skills()
neighbors = vss.find_nearest('target-skill', k=5)
```
