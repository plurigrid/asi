# Slack GIF Creator - Flexible Toolkit

A toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack. Provides validators for Slack's constraints, composable animation primitives, and optional helper utilities. **Apply these tools however needed to achieve the creative vision.**

## Slack's Requirements

Slack has specific requirements for GIFs based on their use:

**Message GIFs:**
- Max size: ~2MB
- Optimal dimensions: 480x480
- Typical FPS: 15-20
- Color limit: 128-256
- Duration: 2-5s

**Emoji GIFs:**
- Max size: 64KB (strict limit)
- Optimal dimensions: 128x128
- Typical FPS: 10-12
- Color limit: 32-48
- Duration: 1-2s

**Emoji GIFs are challenging** - the 64KB limit is strict. Strategies that help:
- Limit to 10-15 frames total
- Use 32-48 colors maximum
- Keep designs simple
- Avoid gradients
- Validate file size frequently

## Toolkit Structure

This skill provides three types of tools:

1. **Validators** - Check if a GIF meets Slack's requirements
2. **Animation Primitives** - Composable building blocks for motion (shake, bounce, move, kaleidoscope)
3. **Helper Utilities** - Optional functions for common needs (text, colors, effects)

**Complete creative freedom is available in how these tools are applied.**

## Core Validators

To ensure a GIF meets Slack's constraints, use these validators:

```python
from core.gif_builder import GIFBuilder

# After creating your GIF, check if it meets requirements
builder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)
# ... add your frames however you want ...

# Save and check size
info = builder.save('emoji.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True)

# The save method automatically warns if file exceeds limits
# info dict contains: size_kb, size_mb, frame_count, duration_seconds
```

**File size validator**:
```python
from core.validators import check_slack_size

# Check if GIF meets size limits
passes, info = check_slack_size('emoji.gif', is_emoji=True)
# Returns: (True/False, dict with size details)
```
