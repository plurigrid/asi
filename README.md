# Plurigrid ASI Local Skills

GF(3)-conserved skill triads for Artificial Superintelligence.

## Skill Triads

### BB(6) Oracle Triad

| Skill | Trit | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `busy-beaver-oracle` | +1 | Generate BB(n) lower bound proofs, emit $BEAVER |
| `levin-levity` | 0 | Nash equilibrium between LEVITY/LEVIN, WEV extraction |
| `prediction-market-oracle` | -1 | Price discovery on cryptid machines |

**Sum: (+1) + (0) + (-1) = 0** ✓ GF(3) conserved

## Skills

### levin-levity

Leonid Levin's algorithmic complexity meets playful mutual ingression.

- **Levin Search**: Universal algorithm running all programs in parallel, weighted by 2^(-|p|)
- **Kolmogorov Complexity**: K(x) = shortest program producing x
- **LEVITY-LEVIN Game**: Nash equilibrium between exploration and convergence
- **WEV Extraction**: World Extractable Value from uncoordinated proof efforts

### autopoiesis

Self-modifying AI agent configuration via ruler + MCP + DuckDB.
