# PR: Levin-Levity Skill for BB(6) WEV Extraction

## Summary

Adds the `levin-levity` skill synthesizing Leonid Levin's algorithmic complexity theory with playful mutual ingression of minds for BB(6) prediction market coordination.

## The Duality

```
LEVIN (-1)  ←→  LEVITY (+1)
     \          /
      \        /
       ERGODIC (0)
         ↓
   Nash Equilibrium
```

- **LEVIN**: Convergence, compression, Kolmogorov complexity
- **LEVITY**: Exploration, expansion, serendipitous discovery
- **ERGODIC**: Nash equilibrium extracting WEV from their mixing time differential

## World Extractable Value (WEV)

| World | Strategy | τ_mix | Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| W_Nash (uncoordinated) | Solo provers | years | 100 human-years |
| W_Opt (market-coordinated) | $BEAVER prediction market | months | 10 human-years |

**WEV = 90 human-years of extractable proof effort**

## GF(3) Triad

| Skill | Trit | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| busy-beaver-oracle | +1 | Generate lower bound proofs |
| levin-levity | 0 | Nash equilibrium + WEV pricing |
| prediction-market-oracle | -1 | Market-making |

**Sum: 0** ✓ GF(3) CONSERVED

## Key Features

1. **Levin Search**: Universal algorithm weighted by 2^(-|p|)
2. **Kolmogorov Rewards**: `BEAVER_REWARD = log₃(BB(n)) × MULTIPLIER`
3. **LEVITY-LEVIN Game**: Best response dynamics for synthesis scheduling
4. **WEV Extraction**: Arbitrage between market and proof mixing times

## Files Changed
